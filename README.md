# Pacman-AI
This uses the UC Berkeley AI codebase for their Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class. These projects utilize search algorithms for artificial intelligence agents and reinforcement learning.

Search algorithms:
- search.py: contains BFS, DFS, uniform-cost search, and AStar search algorithms.
- searchAgents.py: generates the corners heuristic and solves the corners problem.
